A play by play program for football games that will allow you to analyze plays based on several different criteria. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

* When a drive is finished, click the "End Drive" button to store the drive.
* You can alter the QB, HB, Score, Down, Distance, and current yardline at any time with the
'Change Score/Players/Info' buttons.
* When you are finished with game, make sure you end the last drive, and then click the "Results" button.
